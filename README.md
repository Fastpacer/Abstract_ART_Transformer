# Abstract Art Video Transformer Using GAN

This project transforms static images into artistic videos using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). The goal is to apply various artistic styles, such as cubism, impressionism, and surrealism, to create visually engaging video content from user-uploaded images.

## Features
- Transform images into artistic videos using GAN.
- Support for various artistic styles (cubism, impressionism, surrealism).
- Adjustable duration for video output.
- Interactive user interface built with Gradio for easy image uploads and settings.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- TensorFlow and TensorFlow Hub
- OpenCV
- Gradio
- NumPy
- PIL (Pillow)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Abstract-ART-Transformer.git
